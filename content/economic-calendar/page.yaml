    - question: What is an economic calendar?
      answer: >-
        An economic calendar is a schedule of upcoming economic data releases
        and events that can influence financial markets. It serves as a roadmap
        for traders and investors to anticipate potential market volatility and
        prepare accordingly.
    - question: How can the economic calendar support your trading strategy?
      answer: >-
        An economic calendar highlights upcoming market-moving events and key
        data releases. It usually shows:

        Event type (e.g., interest rate decisions, GDP, inflation, employment
        reports)

        Release time (adjusted to global or local time zones)

        Previous, Forecast & Actual values for each indicator

        Expected market impact level to show how strongly the event may move
        prices

        This information helps traders quickly assess what’s happening, when
        it’s happening, and how it could affect the markets.
    - question: How do traders use the economic calendar?
      answer: >-
        Traders use the economic calendar to stay ahead of market-moving
        events. 

        They can:

        Plan trades ahead of scheduled releases by choosing entry and exit
        levels before volatility hits.

        Adjust or close open positions to reduce risk when high-impact news is
        expected.

        Wait for the news to drop, then analyze how the market reacts before
        executing a trade.

        Compare Actual vs. Forecast vs. Previous data to decide whether price
        movements are likely to continue or reverse.

        Look for opportunities created by unexpected results, such as
        stronger-than-expected employment, inflation, or interest rate
        decisions.
    - question: Is the economic calendar always accurate?
      answer: >-
        The calendar uses information from official sources such as the U.S.
        Bureau of Labor Statistics, Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank
        of England, national statistics offices and other global organizations
        that publish economic data. Prices, forecasts and release times are
        collected from these institutions and trusted financial data providers.

        Although the information comes from reliable sources, it may still
        change without notice. Official figures can be revised, and markets can
        react differently than expected.
    - question: Does the economic calendar count as trading advice?
      answer: >-
        No. The calendar is provided for informational and educational purposes
        only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.
        Traders should always conduct their own analysis before making any
        trading decisions.
