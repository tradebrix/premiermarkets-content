subtitle: >-
  An ECN (Electronic Communication Network) account connects you directly to
  top-tier liquidity providers, giving you access to raw spreads with no
  markups. While Standard accounts build fees into the spread, ECN accounts
  charge a small commission and provide raw market pricing, making them the
  preferred choice for traders seeking tighter spreads and faster execution.
