title: What is a PAMM Account?
titleHighlight: PAMM
subtitle: >-
  A PAMM account lets you allocate funds to a professional money manager instead
  of trading by yourself. You choose a manager and decide how much to invest.
  Whenever the manager trades, the PAMM system applies the same strategy to your
  account in proportion to your allocation and updates your balance
  automatically.
