  - question: What is an ECN account?
    answer: >-
      An ECN account gives you direct access to top-tier liquidity providers
      with no dealing desk intervention. Prices come straight from the market,
      resulting in raw spreads and fast execution.
  - question: How does ECN pricing work?
    answer: >-
      Your orders are matched directly with banks and liquidity providers at the
      best available price. Premier Markets does not add markups, so you trade
      raw spreads with a transparent commission per trade.
  - question: Which platforms can I use with the ECN account?
    answer: >-

      manual, automated or high-speed trading.
  - question: Who is the ECN account designed for?

      traders.
