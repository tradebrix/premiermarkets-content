faqItems:
  - question: What is commodities trading?
    answer: >-
      Commodities are standardized natural materials used in energy, food and
      industrial production. Trading them lets you speculate on price movements
      of assets like metals, oil, wheat or sugar. With Premier Markets, you
      trade these prices digitally without owning the physical asset.
  - question: What are the benefits of trading commodities?
    answer: >-
      Commodities add diversification and can help hedge inflation, as assets
      like gold and oil often retain value during uncertainty. Their prices move
      with global supply and demand, creating liquid, transparent markets.
      Traders can find opportunities across sectors influenced by geopolitics,
      weather, economic trends and consumption shifts.
  - question: What are commodity CFDs?
    answer: >-
      A commodity CFD lets you trade price movements without owning the
      underlying asset. Profit or loss is based on the difference between
      opening and closing prices.
  - question: When do commodity CFD orders expire?
    answer: >-
      Futures CFDs expire according to the contract month and close
      automatically. Cash CFDs do not expire and roll over with a price
      adjustment.
  - question: What is the margin for commodities trading?
    answer: >-
      Margin depends on the commodity and market conditions. Traders should
      check live margin rates on the platform and use Premier Markets
      calculators for planning.
  - question: What market changes may affect oil trades?
    answer: >-
      Oil prices react strongly to supply levels, OPEC decisions, geopolitical
      events, inventory data, energy demand and major economic announcements.
  - question: What are the most popular commodities to trade?
    answer: >-

      Corn, Wheat, Coffee, Sugar: affected by weather and harvest cycles

      Copper & Platinum: tied to manufacturing and economic growth


      These markets are favored for their liquidity, clear pricing and
      sensitivity to global trends.
