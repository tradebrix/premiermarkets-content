  - question: What are indices in trading?
    answer: >-
      Indices measure the price movement of a selected group of assets,
      typically stocks, but they can also include bonds or commodities. They
      provide an overall view of how a market, sector or economy is performing,
      making them a key benchmark for traders.
  - question: How are indices calculated and weighted?
    answer: >-
      Indices are generally constructed using one of the following approaches:

      Market-capitalization weighted:  Companies with higher market value have a
      larger effect on the index movement. Examples: S&P 500, FTSE 100.

      Price-weighted:  Stocks with a higher share price carry more influence
      regardless of company size. Examples: Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nikkei
      225.
  - question: Can you trade an index directly?
    answer: >-
      No. Index values cannot be bought or sold directly because they are only
      measurements. Traders gain exposure through financial instruments such as
      CFDs, futures, ETFs or index funds, which replicate or speculate on index
      price movements. 
  - question: What influences index prices?
    answer: |-
      Index prices react to broad economic and market conditions, including:
      Economic data and central bank decisions
      Earnings results from index-listed companies
      Interest rate changes and geopolitical events
      Adjustments to the index’s constituent list
  - question: What are some of the most traded indices?
    answer: |-

      S&P 500 (US 500)
      Dow Jones (Wall Street)

      FTSE 100 (UK 100)
      DAX 40 (Germany 40)
      Nikkei 225 (Japan 225)
  - question: When are indices traded?
    answer: >-
      Trading hours depend on the exchange of each index. Through products like
      CFDs and futures, many indices are available nearly 24 hours, five days a
      week.
