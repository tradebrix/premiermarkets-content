  - question: How are metals traded?
    answer: >-
      Metals can be traded in different forms depending on the market.

      Gold and Silver are typically traded as spot instruments, meaning they
      reflect current market prices for immediate settlement.

      Other metals, such as copper, palladium and platinum, are often traded
      through CFD futures, which allow traders to speculate on future pricing.
  - question: Can you trade metals without owning the physical asset?
    answer: >-
      Yes. Traders can speculate on price movements digitally using instruments
      such as CFDs, ETFs, or futures, which provide exposure to metal prices
      without the need for physical ownership, storage, or insurance.
  - question: Do metal CFD futures expire?
    answer: >-
      Yes. Metal CFD futures have scheduled expiration dates. When a contract
      expires, any open position closes automatically. As expiration approaches,
      the next contract cycle becomes available for trading.
  - question: What are the symbols for spot gold and silver?
    answer: |-
      Spot metals are quoted against major currencies. Common examples include:
      Gold (XAU): XAU/USD, XAU/EUR, XAU/GBP, XAU/CHF, XAU/JPY, XAU/AUD
      Silver (XAG): XAG/USD
  - question: Is there an expiration date on spot gold and silver?
    answer: >-
      No. Spot metals do not expire. As long as margin requirements are met,
      positions remain open until the trader chooses to close them. 
  - question: What are the trading hours for metals?
    answer: >-
      Metals markets are generally open 23 hours a day, 5 days a week, with a
      short daily maintenance break. Trading schedules may also follow global
      exchange holiday closures.
  - question: Can I hold metal positions over the weekend and holidays?
    answer: >-
      Yes, but rollover charges apply, similar to forex trades, when holding
      positions after market close or across non-trading days.

      Copper
  - question: How is margin calculated for metals?
    answer: >-
      Margin requirements differ based on the specific metal, market conditions
      and the trading instrument selected. Traders should always check the live
      margin rates listed on the platform before opening a position. You can
      always refer to our trading calculators to better plan your trades.
  - question: What affects the price of metals?
    answer: >-
      Metal prices are influenced by supply and demand dynamics, mining output,
      geopolitical developments and macroeconomic factors such as:

      US dollar movements (most metals are priced in USD)

      Central bank policies and interest rates

      Market sentiment (safe-haven demand during uncertainty)

      Economic data releases and global risk trends
  - question: Which metals are best to trade?
    answer: >-
      Gold and silver are the most commonly traded due to their high liquidity
      and reputation as safe-haven assets. Silver tends to show greater price
      swings than gold, which can appeal to traders seeking volatility.
  - question: Do metals protect against inflation?
    answer: >-
      Historically, gold and silver have been used as hedges against inflation,
      as they are often viewed as stores of value when purchasing power
      declines. However, their performance can still fluctuate based on market
      conditions.
