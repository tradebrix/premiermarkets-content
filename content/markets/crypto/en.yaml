  - question: What are cryptocurrencies?
    answer: >-
      Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that operate without government or
      central bank control. They use encryption technology to create, secure and
      transfer units of currency. Stored in digital wallets, cryptocurrencies
      enable peer-to-peer transactions and are accepted by a growing number of
      online merchants.
  - question: >-
      Do I need a virtual wallet to trade cryptocurrency CFDs with Premier
      Markets?
    answer: >-
      No. When trading crypto CFDs, you are speculating on price movements
      rather than owning the underlying asset, so there is no need for a digital
      wallet, private keys or physical storage.
  - question: Can I trade cryptocurrency CFDs on Premier Markets platforms?
    answer: >-
      Cryptocurrency CFDs are available on our supported platforms, MT5 and
      Premier WebTrader, that provide crypto trading access. These are separate
      from traditional wallet-based exchanges because they allow traders to go
      long or short without directly holding the coins. 
  - question: Are cryptocurrencies CFDs traded with leverage?
    answer: >-
      Yes. Cryptocurrency CFDs are leveraged products, which means traders only
      need to place a margin deposit to open a larger position. While leverage
      can increase potential returns, it also multiplies losses and should be
      used with caution. 
  - question: Can I short cryptocurrency CFDs with Premier Markets?
    answer: >-
      Yes. With crypto CFDs, you can trade both directions. You can go long if
      you believe prices will rise or short if you believe they will fall,
      giving you the ability to trade in both bullish and bearish market
      conditions.
  - question: How do cryptocurrency CFDs work?
    answer: >-
      When trading crypto CFDs, you enter into a contract based on the price
      movement of a cryptocurrency between the time you open and close the
      position.

      No Ownership: You don’t buy or store the actual coins.

      Leverage: Only a fraction of the total trade value is required.

      Bidirectional Trading: You can trade rising or falling prices.
