  - question: What is share trading with Premier Markets?
    answer: >-
      Share trading lets you speculate on the price movements of publicly listed
      companies. With Premier Markets, you trade share CFDs, meaning you can
      trade rising or falling prices without owning the underlying shares or
      taking ownership of the company.
  - question: How do I trade shares?
    answer: >-
      Open a Premier Markets trading account, choose the shares you want to
      trade, research the company and its sector, and then enter your position. 
  - question: What are the best shares to trade?
    answer: >-
      It depends on your trading style and goals. Some traders focus on large,
      highly traded companies such as Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet
      or Meta, while others look for opportunities in growth stocks or more
      volatile markets. Choose shares that match your risk tolerance and
      strategy.
  - question: What’s the difference between investing and CFD trading?
    answer: >-
      Investing involves buying and holding actual shares for long-term growth.
      CFD trading focuses on short- to medium-term price movements without
      taking ownership. Share CFDs offer leverage and the ability to trade both
      rising and falling markets but also carry higher risk.
  - question: What are the costs of trading share CFDs?
    answer: >-
      When trading share CFDs, your main costs include the spread and any
      overnight financing charges for positions held after the market closes.
      There is no stamp duty since you are not buying the underlying share.
